# GraphShiny

The flow of clinical trials data can quickly become complicated. The dashboard presented can help programmers and project managers understand the data flow and quickly catch discrepancies

The dashboard can help answer such questions as:  
- What datasets are used to create SDTM VS dataset on our study?
- Are all raw datasets used?
- Who should I notify if the underlying dataset changes?  

#### Graph showing connections between all the datasets

#### Graph showing selected connections
Selecting a single node makes graph filter underlying dataset and show connections only for that dataset

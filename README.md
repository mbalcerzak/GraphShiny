# GraphShiny

The flow of clinical trials data can quickly become complicated. The dashboard presented can help programmers and project managers understand the data flow and quickly catch discrepancies

**The dashboard helps with:**
- visually exploring dataset connections  
- ensuring that all main/QC programmers get notified if the underlying dataset changes  
- making sure all raw datasets are necessary and used on the study  
- checking if real data flow agrees with specification and industry/company standards

## Graph showing selected connections
Selecting a single node makes graph filter underlying dataset and show connections only for that dataset
